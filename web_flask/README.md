## What is a Web Framework

A web framework is a software framework designed to aid in the development of web applications by providing libraries, tools, and APIs to streamline common tasks such as handling HTTP requests, managing routing, and generating HTML responses.

## Building a Web Framework with Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it ideal for developing web applications of all sizes. Flask provides a simple and intuitive interface for building web applications and offers extensions for additional functionality when needed.

## Defining Routes in Flask

Routes in Flask define the mapping between URLs and the Python functions that handle HTTP requests for those URLs. Each route specifies a URL pattern and the function that should be called when a request matches that pattern.

## Understanding Routes

Routes in Flask allow developers to create URL patterns that correspond to different parts of their web application. By defining routes, developers can control how incoming HTTP requests are processed and routed to the appropriate functions for handling.

## Handling Variables in Routes

Flask routes can contain variable parts, enclosed in `< >`, which can capture values from the URL and pass them as arguments to the corresponding function. This allows for dynamic routing based on user input or other criteria.

## Using Templates in Flask

Templates in Flask are HTML files that contain placeholders for dynamic content. They allow developers to separate the presentation layer from the application logic, making it easier to maintain and customize web pages.

## Creating HTML Responses with Templates

Flask allows developers to render HTML responses using templates. By passing data to templates from Python functions, developers can dynamically generate HTML content and display it to users in response to their requests.

## Creating Dynamic Templates

Dynamic templates in Flask allow for conditional logic, loops, and other programming constructs within HTML files. This enables developers to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

## Displaying Data from a MySQL Database in HTML

Flask applications can interact with MySQL databases to retrieve data and display it in HTML templates. This allows developers to build database-driven web applications using Flask and MySQL.
